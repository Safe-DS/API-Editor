This does not take label imbalance into account.\n``'weighted'``:\n    Calculate metrics for each label, and find their average weighted\n    by support (the number of true instances for each label). This\n    alters 'macro' to account for label imbalance; it can result in an\n    F-score that is not between precision and recall.
