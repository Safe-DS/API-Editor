  abstract: >-
    A major hurdle for students and professional
    software developers who want to enter the world of
    machine learning (ML), is mastering not just the
    scientific background but also the available ML
    APIs, Therefore, we address the challenge of
    creating APIs that are easy to learn and use,
    especially by novices. However, it is not clear how
    this can be achieved without compromising
    expressiveness. We investigate this problem for
    scikit-learn, a widely used ML API. In this paper,
    we analyze its use by the Kaggle community,
    identifying unused and apparently useless parts of
    the API that can be eliminated without affecting
    client programs. In addition, we discuss usability
    issues in the remaining parts, propose related
    design improvements and show how they can be
    implemented by semi-automated wrapping of the
    existing third-party API.
